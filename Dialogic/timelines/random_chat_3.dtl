Java comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes a wide range of classes and methods for tasks such as data structures, networking, file I/O, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This extensive library simplifies development by providing pre-built functionality that developers can leverage, reducing the need to write code from scratch for common tasks.
