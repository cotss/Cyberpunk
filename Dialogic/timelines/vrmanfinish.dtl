Oh hey! You made it!
Let's see what you collected.
OMG this is amazing, these lines are for a switch function in java!
public class SimpleSwitch {\: This line declares a public class named SimpleSwitch. In Java, every executable program needs to be within a class.
public static void main(String[] args) {\: This line declares the main method, which is the entry point of the Java program. It's where the program starts execution.
int choice = 2;\: This line declares an integer variable named choice and assigns it the value 2. This variable will be used to determine which case to execute in the switch statement.
switch(choice) {\: This line begins the switch statement. It evaluates the value of the choice variable and executes the code block associated with the matching case.
case 1\:\: This line defines the first case of the switch statement. It specifies that if the value of choice is 1, the code within this case will be executed.
System.out.println("You chose option 1");\: This line prints the message "You chose option 1" to the console if choice is 1.
This line is used to exit the switch statement once a case has been executed. Without the break statement, the code would continue to execute the subsequent cases regardless of whether their conditions are met.
case 2\:\: This line defines the second case of the switch statement. It specifies that if the value of choice is 2, the code within this case will be executed.
\: This line specifies the default case, which is executed if none of the other cases match the value of choice.
System.out.println("Invalid choice");\: This line prints the message "Invalid choice" to the console if the value of choice does not match any of the cases.
This line marks the end of the switch statement.
This line marks the end of the main method.
This line marks the end of the SimpleSwitch class.
you can go and collect that trophy! You deserve it!
